NAME
bin-deb-upl.sh - Upload Debian packages to Bintray.
SYNOPSIS
bin-deb-upl.sh [OPTION]
DESCRIPTION
This script uploads all Debian packages in the current directory to Bintray. It
parses the filename to extract the package name, version and distribution. It then formats this information into a curl command conforming to the Bintray API.

It is not possible for the script to determine success or failure as the curl
command may succeed whilst the Bintray API rejects the request. The message
returned from Bintray must be visually checked.

The script looks in ~/.bintray.conf for Bintray related information. If this
file does not exist the information is requested and the file created.
OPTIONS
-h, --help  prints usage information

-v, --verbose  output more information

-V, --version  prints version information
EXIT STATUS
0
if OK,

1
on failure.
